## News
### May 21, 2025
* Elijah Needham presented our conference paper “Large Language Models for Automated Characterization of Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities using N-Shot Learning” at FLAIRS-38 in Daytona Beach! This paper explores how LLMs can be leveraged to characterize vulnerabilities only using limited training data.

* Colby Edell presented our research paper “FSProtoTransfer: Synergizing Few-Shot, Prototypical Networks, and Transfer Learning for Intrusion Detection in VANETs.” at 38th Annual Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference (FLAIRS-38) in Daytona Beach, Florida.
